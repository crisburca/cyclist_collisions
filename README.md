# Analyzing Pedestrian and Cyclist Collisions and Overall Saftey from 2006 to 2022 in Toronto
## Abstract
This paper examines trends and correlations of cyclist and pedestrian collisions in Toronto from years 2006-2022. This paper is meant to infer on patterns of injuries and their severities, and attempt to interpret the cause for the trend of these accidents. We will investigate how the city of Toronto is navigating solutions to these trends. Results show a general downward trend of overall injuries, due to various circumstances.
